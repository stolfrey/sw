		<div>Dairy methane emissions: from threat to opportunity

		<div>Summary Everybody knows that methane from livestock is a big problem. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about a third of global heating so far; livestock emit around a third of total man-made methane emissions today; and demand for meat and dairy is growing worldwide. But the problem is even bigger than most realise. That’s because the scientific consensus about sources of agricultural methane emissions enshrined in the IPCC methodology appears to be wrong. Recent research suggests that emissions from slurry lagoons – widely used in dairy farming – have been significantly underestimated for decades. Studies in several countries have shown through direct measurement that lagoon emissions are between three and six times higher than official estimates. The bad news is that total livestock methane emissions – including both those from slurry lagoons and the ‘enteric’ emissions caused by the belching and farting of the animals themselves - are also larger than estimated. The overall problem is even worse than we thought.

		<div></div>
		<div>The better news is that commercial technologies are already available to capture slurry lagoon methane, which can then be used to fuel vehicles or generate electricity, reducing the warming impact by a factor of 28 or more than 96%. The really good news is that if Britain’s 7,500 dairy farms captured their slurry lagoon methane they would generate huge benefits for both the climate and the economy. This would significantly reduce Britain’s total methane emissions, helping to achieve the country’s Global Methane Pledge, and produce fuel worth £655 million per year. The carbon savings would be worth £308 million if traded. The average sized dairy farm could produce enough biomethane to displace all its diesel consumption and have at least as much again to sell into the local market, with a headline value of almost £52,360 per year. The income would benefit not just farmers but also wider rural communities.
</div>
		<div>Research and development priorities:
</div>
		<div>Recommendations Capturing slurry lagoon methane is certain to be economic in time. Britain’s dairy sector is under pressure, however, and cannot make the whole investment alone. It will need some policy support, which would be entirely justified given the vast emissions savings quickly within reach. To stimulate investment to capture and use methane from slurry, we recommend the government should:
</div>
		<div>Support research into real world relationships between methane emissions from slurry and different storage methods and animal management practicesTransition to Tier 3 inventory assessment for dairy cows Review inventory calculations against the latest research Carry out on farm measurements to validate the updated assessmentExtend the review of methane inventory calculations to other types of livestock and wastewaterStimulate methane capture and use supply chain, through for example increased investment in equipment development for off-grid gas supply and use</div>
		<div>Increase grants/loans for slurry covers, only a third of which currently receive subsidy, and extend such financial support to associated gas processing equipment, which is not currently included Provide a feed in tariff or Contract for Difference for electricity generated from biomethaneProvide  support for small anaerobic digesters (AD) and lagoon capture where the biomethane is not injected into the gas grid, which are not currently supported by the UK Green Gas Support Scheme. The current arrangement effectively restricts support to large, centralised AD plants that depend on transporting waste long distances and excludes decentralised farm-scale projects. Provide tax breaks for supply chain investment in methane recovery and use, such as investments by milk processors in supplier farms Simplify planning/permitting processes for all of the aboveMaintain Renewable Transport Fuel Credits for biomethane from lagoon capture and AD, recognising their emissions abatement via credits Provide a fast track for farmers to upgrade their electricity grid capacity for off take and feed in to enable a distributed local energy grid capabilitySupport the value chain for byproducts from AD, includingCO2 anddigestate</div>
		<div>There are 7,500 dairy producers in the UK and a total of 1,854,000 dairy cows. The average herd size is therefore 148.

If we assume – as shown in our paper - that slurry lagoons emit 170kg of methane per cow per year, then the UK total is 317 million kg or 317,000 tonnes.

In energy terms, that contains the same energy as 437 million litres of diesel, which at £1.50 per litre would be worth almost £656 million. For the average sized herd that represents over £52,000 per year.

In terms of carbon, based on the 100-year methane GWP of 26 (IPCC), burning each kg of methane saves 26kg of CO2 minus 2.75 kg of CO2 emitted by that burning. This gives a CO2e saving of 7.3 million tonnes, which, at the current UK carbon price of £42.05/tCO2e, would be worth £308 million.

This carbon saving equates to £520 per cow per year, or 17% of the value of its milk. assuming 41pence per litre and 8,200 litres per cow per year. For the average sized herd that represents almost £77,000 per year.

The methane challenge

You could be forgiven for thinking that the world is finally getting to grips with methane, the powerful but short-lived greenhouse gas responsible for 30% of global heating so far. Since 2021, when the EU and US launched the Global Methane Pledge at COP26 in Glasgow, over 150 countries have committed to reduce their collective emissions 30% by 2030. Fulfilling this promise is vital if we are to have the slightest chance of keeping 1.5C on life support. But the world has not yet got to grips with methane. The Global Methane Pledge focuses largely on the energy sector because the problem here is big leaks from oil and gas infrastructure. These are easy to spot by satellite – unless deliberately concealed and many would be economic to fix, so there should be easy wins. The Global Methane Pledge has less to say about agriculture, however, even though this is the biggest source of man-made methane. Worse, it commits members to following an IPCC reporting methodology based on consensus assumptions that new research suggests are wrong. If the consensus assumptions are wrong, there are two major implications. The bad news is that methane emissions from livestock are even larger than we thought. The good news is we can now tackle far more of the problem through proven technologies that also provide valuable income to farming communities. Methane emissions are tiny compared to carbon dioxide by weight, but since methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas - 86 times more potent over 20 years, roughly the remaining time to 2050 - it has caused around 30% of global heating so far. Methane is not only powerful but also short-lived in the atmosphere, however, which means that cutting its emissions would benefit the climate more quickly than reducing CO2. Reducing methane emissions should therefore be the highest priority for policymakers striving to achieve Nez Zero.

</div>

		<div>The faulty consensus 

Methane emissions from livestock are generally divided into two categories: enteric, meaning those produced by the burps and – to a lesser extent – farts of the animals themselves; and ‘manure management’, which in dairy farming usually means collecting dung from the farmyard and storing it in a lagoon or tank until it can be sprayed onto fields as fertilizer. In the lagoon, microbes digest the slurry anaerobically to produce methane, which then bubbles to the surface and into the atmosphere. Agricultural methane emissions are more diffuse than those from leaking gas pipelines and far harder to detect by satellite. The scientific consensus holds that enteric emissions are by far the largest source of agricultural methane. A paper published by the Royal Society, for example, found that the world’s livestock emitted 100 million tonnes of enteric methane in 2017, while its slurry lagoons gave off just 10 million. This 10:1 ratio is at the upper end of range of estimates, but many other studies find a ratio of between 3:1 and 6:1. </div>
		<div>National estimates of methane emissions from livestock are calculated under an IPCC methodology introduced in 2006 and updated periodically, most recently in 2020. This codifies a series of assumptions, based on research from the 1970s to 1990s, including the idea that the bulk of livestock methane emissions are enteric.  Although emissions vary by country and climate, the consensus more recently has been that enteric emissions outweigh those from slurry lagoons by around 3:1. 
Recent research suggests the consensus is wrong. Studies in Canada, Denmark, the US and the UK, which measured the emissions directly, have found that enteric emissions broadly agreed with the IPCC framework but that those from slurry lagoons were far higher.

</div>
		<div>The IPCC method The science of the IPCC methane emissions reporting framework introduced in 2006 is based on a small set of studies from the preceding decades. There are three tiers of assessment. Tier 1 is the simplest and applies average temperatures and geography. Tier 2 is the most widely used among developed countries and more detailed; it applies emissions factors and region-or-country specific data on for example temperatures, feed types and livestock weight. Tier 3 is the most sophisticated and incorporates some field measurements. For manure management, Tier 2 works by establishing the maximum amount of methane that could be produced from a given amount of manure in a country, and then applies a locally specific discount rate to estimate how much was actually emitted. It is the use of these discount rates that appears to cause most of the inaccuracy identified by more recent research (see below). Within the discount rates, two assumptions underpin the IPCC approach. First, that warmer ambient air temperatures lead to greater methane emissions from manure, and second, that enteric emissions outweigh manure emissions by around 3:1. Neither assumption looks tenable any longer.  
</div>
		<div>International research
 
For more than a decade, studies from Europe and North America have increasingly questioned the accuracy of the IPPC assessment framework for methane emissions from manure management. 
The first was a meta-study published in 2014 that re-analysed results from 38 earlier papers. It found that measured emissions from slurry lagoons were up to three times higher than suggested by the IPPC method. 
But that came before the advent of more sophisticated measuring technologies. Since then, a Canadian study has found manure emissions were a third higher than the country’s official figure. A Danish study of nine farms found that direct measurements produced results 35% higher than the IPCC method. 
In Cyprus, another study found methane emissions at dairy sites were 40% higher. In California, a study of 135 dairies showed manure emissions were more than twice as large as enteric (332kg per cow compared to 144kg). And in Italy, researchers found direct measurement of manure emissions to be three to nine times higher than IPCC estimates.  
</div>
		<div>British research

In Britain, researchers monitored slurry lagoon emissions at two farms in Cornwall continuously for a year during 2022-23. Here the methane was captured, processed, compressed and most of it used as vehicle fuel. Like the international studies, the British research found that slurry lagoons produce far more methane than the IPCC suggests. The Tier 2 method on which the UK National Inventory is based estimates UK slurry lagoon emissions per cow at 38kg, whereas this study measured 145kg at one farm and 198kg at the other – between 3.8 and 5.2 times greater. The average of the two farms was 171.5kg, or 4.5 times higher than the official number. On this basis, total UK slurry emissions would be 4.5 times higher, or 318,000 tonnes per year rather than the reported 71,000 thousand tonnes. Total methane emissions from dairy cows would be 548 thousand tonnes rather than the reported 301 thousand tonnes, an increase of almost 50%. Manure management would make up 58% of all dairy methane emissions rather than the reported 23%. By these measurements, and in contrast to the entire debate so far, slurry emissions are somewhat larger than enteric emissions. The ratio between enteric and slurry emissions is no longer 3:1 but more like 1:1 at best.

</div>
		<div>Skewed R&D priorities
 
Because the consensus has been that enteric emissions are many times greater than those from manure, support for technology R&D has focussed overwhelmingly on that source. 
For instance, Global Methane Pledge countries announced an Enteric Fermentation R&D Accelerator with $200 million of funding at COP28 in 2023, whereas no equivalent initiative exists for manure management. 
It is true that several technologies to abate enteric emissions such as feed additives, selective breeding and vaccines are showing promise. But these are unlikely to reduce methane emissions significantly by 2030, and in any case no longer represent the biggest source of the problem. By contrast, the technologies needed to tackle dairy manure emissions are proven and commercially available already. 
</div>
		<div>The opportunity for Britain
 
If UK methane emissions from slurry lagoons are far higher than official estimates, it is a major problem but also an enormous resource. The potential savings in GHG emissions are huge and could be achieved far more quickly than focusing on enteric methane or carbon dioxide. The fuel that could be produced could be worth £655 million to farming communities in the UK. And the technologies needed to make this happen are already well established. 
Tackling methane emissions from manure - unlike enteric emissions - requires no major R&D breakthroughs; we already know how to capture and exploit methane coming off a slurry lagoon. 
In Britain, companies including Bennamann and QUBE have developed systems for capturing and processing methane emitted from slurry lagoons, while CNH Industrial has developed a methane-powered New Holland tractor, which is built in Essex. Slurry lagoon biogas companies also exist in France, Germany and the US. 
In Cornwall, the County Council has sponsored six farms to take part in a slurry biogas project which should provide enough fuel for 60 local authority vehicles at full capacity. Slurry is scraped from farm buildings and yards into a reception lagoon then pumped into the slurry lagoon, which is covered by an airtight cover. The gas is captured under the cover and removed periodically, processed and compressed or liquified into a fuel that can be used in vehicles. The system is already operating on three of the six farms, and if applied across the country, the emissions and financial savings could be enormous. 
Britain’s total methane emissions have already fallen sharply, down by almost two thirds since 1990. But that’s largely because of the elimination of coal fired power, decline in North Sea oil and gas production and diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill. 
Methane emissions from agriculture have fallen by far less, down 15% between 1990 and 2010 as the UK herd shrank, and scarcely any further since then. As a result, agriculture now produces almost half (48%) of total UK methane emissions and methane accounts for over half (54%) of agriculture’s total greenhouse gas emissions. 
Since it now seems that more than half (58%) of this comes from slurry lagoons, and the technology to capture this gas is already commercially available, this represents an enormous opportunity. The biomethane could displace natural gas in almost any local application – dairies, laundries, industrial heating or even crematoria.

</div>
		<div>Capturing slurry lagoon methane and turning it into vehicle fuel could reduce agricultural methane emissions from the dairy industry by half and total UK methane emissions by a quarter.

If it were used to displace diesel, on the farm and in the local community, the savings equate to the emissions of 2.7 billion litres of diesel, whose total carbon value if traded would be £308 million.  

</div>
		<div>Farmers and local communities

The vehicle fuel and rural incomes generated by this approach would also be significant. If slurry methane emissions average around 170kg per cow per year as we estimate, for an average-sized herd of 148 cows it would produce biogas fuel containing energy equal to 35,000 litres of diesel. With forecourt prices of around £1.50, that would represent a headline benefit of £52,360 per year.

The average dairy farm in Britain consumes 99 litres of diesel per cow, or 13,860 per year.  So if it invested in a biogas tractor, the average farm could be self-sufficient in vehicle fuel, with at least as much again to use for other purposes such as heat or electricity, or to sell into the local market. 
Red diesel consumed on the farm is not subject to duty, however. Allowing for that, and assuming the farmer sells the rest as transport fuel with duty, the net benefit would be £41,.497.   
Along with huge greenhouse gas emissions reductions and higher rural incomes, there would be important co-benefits for farmers and local communities such as less need for manufactured fertilizers
